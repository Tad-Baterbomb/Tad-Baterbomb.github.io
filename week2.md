6/5/2024 - Our task was to use OpenCV and Numpy to capture video from a webcam through Raspberry Pi. 
The designed code captures video from the webcam, and processes each frame to find and highlight rectangular shapes.
It also displays the result in real-time until the user presses 'q' to exit. The next goal is to increase the framerate of the camera.
Currently, it is very slow at processing visual data. A CoralTPU might help with speeding up the framerate though.
