## About My Project

The team project is on Robot Autonomy:

Problem: How can we develop an AI capable of mapping out pattern-detection using Supervised Learning?

Approach: We are using Raspberry Pi 4, OpenCV and Numpy to accomplish object and pattern detection.

Expected Outcome: A successful algorithm will allow the Raspberry Pi to detect objects, depending on the criteria specified in the algorithm's code.
