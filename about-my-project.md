## About My Project

AI Autonomy:

Problem: How do we develop an AI capable of mapping out risk-assessment using Supervised Learning.

Approach: We are using Raspberry Pi 4 and OpenCV to accomplish object and pattern detection.

Expected Outcome: A successful algorithm will allow the Raspberry Pi to detect objects based on the criteria provided in the algorithm's development.
