During the first week, I got to meet the other members and faculty for the CEAMLS program. I also got to see my project team. 
My project team and I discussed some of the intentions and end-goals of the project, and I was able to get aquainted with complex topics
such as Linear Regression, Random Forest Classifier, and more basic rules of coding like datatypes (strings, integers, flows, etc).
Over all, the orientations provided have been very informative and fascinating, although I'm struggling to absorb it all, but that's to be expected
for the first week. I just hope that when teaching, people make it more of a mission to go bit-by-bit before delving into complex terminologies and jargon. 
Nonetheless, I am very excited to develop, and I already feel like I'm learning a lot.
