6/14/2024 - Our task was to train the track-based model using ultralytics and YOLO to account for QR codes and the track itself. 
Some challenges were that training the track-based model with a custom dataset takes a very long time. Amd we had to repeat it a couple of times,
which took a couple of hours for each 50 epochs trained.
